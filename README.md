Python function to clean and extract correctly formatted postcode data.
#### Description
In many situations, postcodes are added to a database field to record people's addresses. However, when entering postcodes by hand or transcribing from written notes, it is often the case that postcodes are entered incorrectly due to typing errors or because the postcode in question is not fully known. Consequently, a variable containing postcode information will contain many correct postcodes but also many incorrect or partial data points. This function seeks to extract correctly formatted postcodes and to correct some commonly occurring transcription errors in order to produce a correctly-formatted postcode. In addition, in situations where just the outward component (first half) of the postcode is recorded, the function will attempt to salvage just the outward component. Finally, the function extracts the postcode area (first 1 or 2 letters) of the postcode. The cleaned postcode (with no spaces and in 7-character format), the outward and inward components of the postcode and the postcode areas are all stored in new variables that are added to the original dataframe.

The names of the variables that will be created to contain the outward and inward components of the postcode are 'postcodeOutward' and 'postcodeInward'. These names are the names of the groups defined by the regular expression and are not user-definable.

The regex used to determine whether postcodes are correctly formatted is a modified regex based on a regex published at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom (accessed 22 Mar 2016). (This page is also stored locally as a PDF entitled, "Talk/Postcodes in the United Kingdom - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia".)
  
#### Function parameters
The function takes the following parameters:

1. **phjTempDF**
  * Pandas dataframe containing a variable that contains postcode information.

2. **phjOrigPostcodeVarName** (default = 'postcode')
  * The name of the variable that contains postcode information.

3. **phjNewPostcodeVarName** (default = 'postcodeClean')
  * The name of the variable that the function creates that will contain 'cleaned' postcode data. The postcodes containing in this column will contain no whitespace. Therefore, A1 2BC will be entered as A12BC.

4. **phjPostcodeFormatCheckVarName** (default = ' postcodeFormatCheck')
  * A binary variable that the function will create that indicates whether the whole postcode (or, if only 2 to 4 characters are entered, the outward component of the postcode) is correctly formatted.

5. **phjPostcode7VarName** (default = 'postcode7')
  * The name of the variable that the function creates that will contain 'cleaned' postcode data in 7-character format. Postcodes can contain 5 to 7 characters. In those postcodes that consist of 5 characters, the outward and inward components will be separated by 2 spaces, in those postcodes that consist of 6 characters, the outward and inward components will be separated by 1 spaces, and in those postcodes that consist of 7 characters there will be no spaces. This format is commonly used in lookup tables that link postcodes to other geographical information.

6. **phjPostcodeAreaVarName** (default = 'postcodeArea')
  * The name of the variable that the function creates that will contain the postcode area (the first 1, 2 or, in very rare cases, 3 letters).

7. **phjDropExisting** (default = False)
  * If set to True, the function will automatically drop any pre-existing columns that have the same name as those columns that need to be created. If set to False, the function will halt.

8. **phjPrintResults** (default = False)
  * If set to True, the function will print information to screen as it proceeds.

#### Exceptions raised
None

#### Returns
By default, function returns the original dataframe with added columns containing postcode data.

#### Other notes
None

#### Example

```python
# Create a test dataframe that contains a postcode variable and some other empty variables
# that have the same names as the new variables that will be created. Setting the 'phjDropExisting'
# variable to true will automatically drop pre-existing variables before running the function.
# Some of the variables in the test dataframe are not duplicated and are present to show that the
# function preserves those variables in tact.

```

Python function to randomly select matched or unmatched case-control data.
#### Description
This function selects case-control datasets from the SAVSNET database. It receives, as parameters, two Pandas dataframes, one containing known cases and, the other, potential controls. The algorithm steps through each case in turn and selects the relevant number of control subjects from the second dataframe, matching on the list of variables. The function then adds the details of the case and the selected controls to a separate, pre-defined dataframe before moving onto the next case.

Initially, the phjSelectCaseControlDataset() function calls phjParameterCheck() to check that passed parameters meet specified criteria (e.g. ensure lists are lists and ints are ints etc.). If all requirements are met, phjParameterCheck() returns True and phjSelectCaseControlDataset() continues.

The function requires a parameter called phjMatchingVariablesList. If this parameter is None (the default), an unmatched case-control dataset is produced. If, however, the parameter is a list of variable names, the function will return a dataset where controls have been matched on the variables in the list.

The phjSelectCaseControlDataset() function proceeds as follows:

1. Creates an empty dataframe in which selected cases and controls will be stored.
2. Steps through each case in the phjCasesDF dataframe, one at a time.
3. Gets data from matched variables for the case and store in a dict
4. Creates a mask for the controls dataframe to select all controls that match the cases in the matched variables
5. Applies mask to controls dataframe and count number of potential matches
6. Adds cases and controls to dataframe (through call to phjAddRecords() function)
7. Removes added control records from potential controls database so single case cannot be selected more than once
8. Returns Pandas dataframe containing list of cases and controls. This dataframe only contains columns for unique identifier, case and group id. It will, therefore need to be merged with the full database to get and additional required columns.

#### Function parameters
The function takes the following parameters:

1. **phjCasesDF**
  * Pandas dataframe containing list of cases.
2. **phjPotentialControlsDF**
  * Pandas dataframe containing a list of potential control cases.
3. **phjUniqueIdentifierVarName**
  * Name of variable that acts as a unique identifier (e.g. consulations ID number would be a good example). N.B. In some cases, the consultation number is not unique but has been entered several times in the database, sometimes in very quick succession (ms). Data must be cleaned to ensure that the unique identifier variable is, indeed, unique.
4. **phjMatchingVariablesList** (Default = None.)
  * List of variable names for which the cases and controls should be matched. Must be a list. The default is None. If 
5. **phjControlsPerCaseInt** (Default = 1.)
  * Number of controls that should be selected per case.
6. **phjPrintResults** (Default= False.)
  * Print verbose output during execution of scripts. If running on Jupyter-Notebook, setting PrintResults = True causes a lot a output and can cause problems connecting to kernel.

#### Exceptions raised
None

#### Returns
Pandas dataframe containing a column containing the unique identifier variable, a column containing case/control identifier and â€“ for matched case-control studies â€“ a column containing a group identifier. The returned dataframe will need to be left-joined with another dataframe that contains additional required variables.

#### Other notes
Setting phjPrintResults = True can cause problems when running script on Jupyiter-Notebook.

#### Example
An example of the function in use is given below:

```python
import pandas as pd

#### Description
This function can be used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for case-control studies. The function is passed a Pandas dataframe containing the data together with the name of the 'case' variable and the name of the potential risk factor variable. The function returns a Pandas dataframe based on a 2 x 2 or n x 2 contingency table together with columns containing the odds, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (Woolf). Rows that contain a missing value in either the case variable or the risk factor variable are removed before calculations are made.

#### Function parameters
The function takes the following parameters:

1. **phjTempDF**
  * This is a Pandas dataframe that contains the data to be analysed. One of the columns should be a variable that indicates whether the row is a case or a control.

2. **phjCaseVarName**
  * Name of the variable that indicates whether the row is a case or a control.

3. **phjCaseValue**
  * The value used in phjCaseVarName variable to indicate a case (e.g. True, yes, 1, etc.)

4. **phjRiskFactorVarName**
  * The name of the potential risk factor to be analysed. This needs to be a categorical variable.

5. **phjRiskFactorBaseValue**
  * The level or stratum of the potential risk factor that will be used as the base level in the calculation of odds ratios.

#### Exceptions raised
